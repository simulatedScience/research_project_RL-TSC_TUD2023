Given a a flow file (JSON format) for vehicle arrivals and routes, this module provides tools to generate variations on that.

1. Generate a new flow file with the same vehicles arriving in the same order but with uniform spacing between arrivals
2. Generate a new flow file with random vehicles arriving uniformly over time with the same route distribution as the original
3. Generate a new flow file with random vehicles arriving at random times with the same route distribution as the original
    At each timestep, sample the number of arrvals from a given function f(t)
