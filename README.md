# Research Project: Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control (@TUD 2023)

This repository contains work for a reasearch project by Sebastian Jost at TU-Dresden in 2023.

## Repository structure
There are some miscellaneous files in the root directory for now, those will be moved to a more appropriate location when the project progresses.
These currently include overviews of related literature (`papers overview.pptx` & `reading_summaries.md`) and notes on planned workflow (`sumo_rl_tsc_workflow.html`).

The code and road networks can be found in `src/`. It is likely that the networks will eventually be moved to a separate folder, but for now they are in the same folder as the code.
Some introductory examples can be found in `src/sumo_python_intro`: a single intersection setup and one with four intersections arranged in a square.

## Future plans
We plan to implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms for Traffic Signal Control in SUMO using Python. The algorithms will be tested on a variety of road networks.
